      <H1>About Robin Grille</H1>
      <p>Robin Grille is a psychologist in private practice and a parenting educator. His articles on parenting and child development have been widely published and translated in Australia and around the world. Robin’s first book: <a href="book-peacefulWorld.html">‘Parenting for a Peaceful World’</a> has received international acclaim and led to speaking engagements around Australia, USA, UK, New Zealand and Canada. His second book, <a href="book-heart2heart.html">‘Heart to Heart Parenting’</a> is now translated into Korean and German. Robin’s work is animated by his belief that humanity’s future is largely dependent on the way we collectively relate to our children.</p>
      <p>Born in Uruguay, South America, into a multicultural family, Robin is fluent in Spanish and English, and haltingly conversant in French and Romanian. He feels a strong affinity for a broad span of cultures, across the universal human family.</p>
      <p>Robin’s experiential, skills-based and informational parenting courses have helped many people to embrace parenting as a transformative, personal growth journey. Drawing from 25 years’ clinical experience and from leading-edge neuropsychological research, Robin’s seminars and courses focus on healthy emotional development for children as well as parents; while building supportive, co-operative parenting communities.   </p>      <p>Use this web site to find out more about:</p>
