      <h2><a name="parenting"></a>Seminar 1<br>
        &quot;Parenting for a Peaceful World&quot;</h2>
      <p><img src="images/seminarParenting.jpg" alt="Parenting For A Peaceful World seminar" width="300" height="225" align="left">Robin Grille invites you on a journey that begins with the surprising and often shocking history and evolution of parenting. With the aid of recent revolutionary discoveries about early childhood development and the human brain, the history of childhood offers vital clues about the roots of human violence and social disharmony. </p>
      <p>This inspirational lecture, based on Robin Grille&rsquo;s book of the same title, will provide a fascinating look at parenting customs that have <br>
        shaped societies and major world events, revealing how children adapt to parenting styles and how these experiences underpin the <br>
        adults they become and, ultimately, the way the world is structured. </p>
      <p>Robin Grille draws upon revolutionary new research to argue that <br>
        safeguarding children&rsquo;s emotional development is the key to creating a more peaceful and harmonious world. </p>
      <p>Robin emphasizes that our future rests on the way we care for parents, and the way we treat children. This presentation takes you from past horrors to present hope. You will learn how recent fundamental changes in child-rearing approaches have shifted human consciousness, giving birth to modern movements for human rights, justice, democracy, equality and sustainability. You will also learn how these universal issues impact on the way that we work with young children and their families. </p>
      <p>Certainly, there is much more work to do. But what would the future hold for humanity if these positive reforms in child-rearing continue to grow? What is your personal role in this unfolding global movement?</p>

Never before has so much been known about how childhood experiences shape the adults we become, and this new knowledge is revolutionising the way we understand our babies and children. Parenting and child care are undergoing great changes in the wake of these discoveries. This presentation will place you at the forefront of these changes. </p>
      <p>In this presentation you will learn:</p>
      <p>&bull; How your affection literally grows your child&rsquo;s brain!<br>
      &bull; How to give your baby and child the most emotionally secure start in life<br>

      <h2><a name="parents"></a>WHEN PARENTS WERE CHILDREN </h2>
      <h3> A workshop for mothers and fathers, with Robin Grille</h3>
      <p><img src="images/seminarParentsWereChildren.jpg" alt="When Parents were Children" width="167" height="250" align="left">Author of Parenting for a Peaceful World (Longueville Media) and Heart to Heart Parenting (ABC Books)</p>
      <p>You may not know it, but your own life as a child is one of the strongest influences on how you parent today.</p>
      <p>Do you remember what it felt like to be a child? Are there some memories you'd rather forget? Some memories that bring you joy? The emotional paths you trod as a child hold a treasury of wisdom. Just to touch lightly upon the emotions of childhood can help you immensely to:</p>
      <p>&bull; Understand your own child better, from the inside<br>
      &bull; Free you from repeating old inherited behaviour patterns<br>
      &bull; Intuit what your baby and child is asking for and know how to meet his/her emotional needs<br>
      &bull; Help your child to trust you and listen to you<br>
      &bull; Help your child to feel heard, seen and secure<br>
      &bull; Heal old emotional wounds and bring more joy to parenting<br>
      &bull; Deepen your sense of connection to others and to your community</p>
      <p>In this workshop you will be shown ways to safely tap into the wisdom of your 'inner child', and gain much trust in your inner knowing about how to respond to your child. This process can be very freeing, empowering, healing for you and richly enhancing of your relationship with your child.</p>
