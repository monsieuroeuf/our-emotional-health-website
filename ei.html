      <H1>Emotional Intelligence and the Emotional Intelligence Test</H1>
      <p>&#8216;<strong>Emotional intelligence</strong>&#8217; includes such things 
        as: <br>
        1. Identifying your feelings and needs, through body-awareness.<br>
        2. The ability to read others&#8217; feelings, and to listen to others 
        with empathy.<br>
        3. Knowing how to express your feelings with words and/or body-language.<br>
        4. Choosing when to contain (not repress) emotion, and when to communicate 
        emotion appropriately.<br>
        5. The ability to process and let go of emotion when necessary.<br>
        6. The willingness to give ourselves time to feel, and to enjoy the depths 
        of our &#8216;selves&#8217; through feeling.<br>
        7. The ability to lead wisely or follow with grace.<br>
        8. The ability to honour our own limits, as well as to celebrate our talents.<br>
        9. The ability to give and receive love.</p>
      <p><a href="book-peacefulWorld.html"><img src="images/pfpw-second-edition.jpg" alt="emotional intelligence test and research  in parenting for a peaceful world" width="89" height="127" border="0" align="left"></a>A 
        rich and colourful tapestry of emotion gives meaning to our lives, and 
        depth to our experiences. Even when we are not consciously aware of emotion, 
        it motivates our behaviour, and drives our every gesture and choice.</p>
      <p>Many of us have learned early in our lives to hide or ignore our feelings, 
        and that is why relationships can become stunted and dull. Relationships 
        cannot be truly intimate, nor can they grow, without a sharing of our 
        emotional inner worlds. Try the <a href="pdf/eiQuestionnaire.pdf" target="_blank">emotional 
        intelligence test</a> to gain insight into areas of your emotional development 
        you might like to expand or develop. <a href="counselling.html">Counselling</a> 
        can help us to develop our emotional intelligence, and thus enrich our 
        relationships and achieve our life&#8217;s goals.</p>
      <p>When it comes to emotional intelligence, every last one of us is learning, 
        evolving and developing, well into adulthood.</p>
      <p><a href="counselling.html">Counselling and psychotherapy</a> are two 
        of many means available to heal our emotional wounds, further develop 
        our emotional intelligence, and revitalize our relationships.</p>
