        Guild AGM, Anzac Memorial Club. Cammeray, Sydney. August 2006.<br>
        Our memories of how it felt to be a child, at every stage of development,
        are perhaps the most powerful influences on how we parent our children.
        Our childhood histories often drive our parenting choices beneath our
        conscious awareness. Bringing emotional memory - from the earliest moments
        of life - to the light of understanding can therefore be a profound service
        to the parenting relationship. There are wonderful and important implications
        for practitioners who work with parents and their children. </p>
