         Our memories of how it felt to be a child, at every stage of development, 
        are perhaps the most powerful influences on how we parent our children. 
        Our childhood histories often drive our parenting choices beneath our 
        conscious awareness. Bringing emotional memory - from the earliest moments 
        of life - to the light of understanding can therefore be a profound service 
        to the parenting relationship. There are wonderful and important implications 
      for practitioners who work with parents and their children.
