      <H1>Children's Wellbeing Manifesto</H1>
      <h2>Policy initiatives promoting healthy emotional development  in children</h2>
      <h4>PREAMBLE</h4>
      <p>All societies are  profoundly shaped - for better or worse - by how we rear children. This has  been the overwhelming conclusion of recent ground-breaking research across a  range of disciplines. A new consensus is emerging on how we should care for our  children. Throwing new light on how best to help children flourish, this  knowledge offers compelling evidence as to the kinds of social policies that  will help all parents in their vital task, thereby reducing a host of societal  dysfunctions, improving public health and social sustainability.</p>
      <p>The following propositions are based on  the best initiatives that have been tried and tested in numerous countries,  and/or withstood rigorous tests of cost-benefit analysis. Such investments in  the wellbeing of children, psychologically as well as physically, have been  convincingly shown to yield economic as well as social rewards far exceeding  the investment. More significantly, they are measures aimed at supporting what  is most important, irreplaceable and ultimately not measurable: familial love  and emotional wellbeing.</p>
      <p>The main source of children&rsquo;s emotional wellbeing comes  from <em>relationships </em>&ndash; from their deepest  attachments to mothers, fathers, grandparents and a few cherished others. Early  childhood in particular is a time when children's wellbeing and capacity to  flourish are overwhelmingly about love, attachment and connectedness, and so it  is a time they should spend mostly in the presence of these vital attachment  figures. In recognition of this universal truth, social policy must re-orient  itself towards supporting young children&rsquo;s right to remain, for the first two  to three years, as much as possible in the presence of their &lsquo;attachment&rsquo;  relationships.</p>
      <p>In a world increasingly driven by imperatives of profit and  market forces, we hold that parental and family love matters most, it is at the  very centre of human and social wellbeing; and thus we propose the following  ways to support parents in the most important job in the world.</p>
      <p>The manifesto addresses the following 15 points;</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Establishment of new community &lsquo;hubs&rsquo; for parent  support called: </strong><br>
          <strong>&lsquo;Parent and Child Support Centres&rsquo; in every  municipality.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Increased support for       early-intervention initiatives, particularly for disadvantaged       populations.</strong><br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Encourage hospitals       to increase their focus on the <em>psychological</em> needs of mothers and infants surrounding labour.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Provide support for       mothers to aim towards full-term breastfeeding (as recommended by the       World Health Organization and UNICEF).</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Extend Medicare       health care cover</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Encourage and expand support  for non-profit, community based or co-operative childcare.</strong></li>
        <li><strong> Improve the  quality of existing childcare.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Support  Children's Right to Play</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Introduce  maternity and paternity leave with pay.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Support  fathers&rsquo; involvement in children&rsquo;s lives.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Workplace Reform: encourage mother/father-friendly workplaces.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Free re-training and remission of education  expenses for all primary caregivers on re-entry to workplace.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Universal free, non-compulsory Preschool       for 3 and 4 year olds.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Legislate  against all corporal punishment of children.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Prohibit television, print and in-school advertising and  marketing that targets children under 12.</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>1. Establishment of new community &lsquo;hubs&rsquo; for parent  support called: </strong><br>
        <strong>&lsquo;Parent and Child Support Centres&rsquo; in every  municipality.</strong><br>
      Parenting is  best done in company - in a convivial community of other parents and  caregivers. Children flourish in connected communities, where social  infrastructure is provided via a &lsquo;hub and spoke&rsquo; model:</p>
      <p>Beginning with  pre-natal visits to connect new parents-to-be to a community hub (the Parent  and Child Support Centre) which provides contact with the local community of  parents, connecting them with a broad range of social networks, services and  facilities for parents and other caregivers. These &lsquo;hub&lsquo; centres should include  &rsquo;spokes&lsquo; &ndash; i.e. outreach to specialist support services where necessary. </p>
      <p>Some existing  similar examples: Danish &lsquo;Folk&rsquo; centres housing children&rsquo;s services and  networks, the Parent Support Centres of Boulder (Colorado) and  Vermont USA, toy libraries, playgroups, Bub Hubs, babysitting clubs, child care  cooperatives, homework clubs staffed by retired volunteers. </p>

        <p><strong>2. Increased support for       early-intervention initiatives, particularly for disadvantaged       populations.</strong> <br>
        Attachment-oriented home visits for all parents  with a new baby, additional for 'at-risk' families. Visits  to be continued after birth to assist new parents, providing practical advice  and support when necessary and assessing the need for additional healthcare  services. A range of combined measures can be  utilised, including income support, parenting support and&nbsp; high quality, childcare programs of a  specialised nature (such as the Perry Preschool) and parenting support programs  such as Newpin and&nbsp; H.I.P.P.Y (NZ Home  Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters. </p>
<p><strong>3. Encourage hospitals       to increase their focus on the <em>psychological</em> needs of mothers and infants surrounding labour.</strong><br>
      Beginning with supporting and respecting mothers&rsquo; autonomy  and right to choose, this can include: increased  support for home-like birthing rooms adjoining hospitals, encouragement of  natural birthing methods and home-births except in cases of clear medical risk. </p>
      <p><strong>4. Provide support for       mothers to aim towards full-term breastfeeding (as recommended by the       World Health Organization and UNICEF).</strong><br>
        Necessary  support includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adequate  maternity leave provisions (see proposition # 8) and workplace reforms (see proposition #10)</li>
        <li>Encouraging maternity hospitals  to comply with UNICEF&rsquo;s &lsquo;Baby-Friendly Hospitals Initiative&rsquo; designation. </li>
        <li>Medicare cover for  breastfeeding support services (see proposition #5)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>5. Extend Medicare       health care cover to include: </strong><br>
  Home visits by Lactation Consultants, Home-birth  midwives and doulas, multi-disciplinary care &ndash; including psychology and  complementary medicine - for maternal and paternal post-natal depression.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Encourage and expand support  for non-profit, community based or co-operative childcare.</strong><br>
        Quality childcare is not compatible with  profit-making for shareholders. Expand support for alternatives to corporate  childcare, especially alternatives that also support working mothers - such as  community childcare services, family day-care, parent co-ops. Provide generous  allowances for grandparent carers. </p>
      <p><strong>7. Improve the  quality of existing childcare.</strong><br>
      Present regulations in Australian childcare are  inadequate in some areas. Increased funding should be explicitly targeted at  improving the quality of existing care. Raise the ratios of caregivers to  babies to 1:2, and improve ratios for toddlers. Keep overall size of centre and  groups small.&nbsp; Introduce national  standards to replace present hodgepodge between states and the Federal  Government. Better pay and training for all childcare workers.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>8. Support  Children's Right to Play.<br>
      </strong>Childhood is  now dominated by the values of a competitive, achievement orientated culture.  It is increasingly spent within the confines of institutions - early childcare,  school, after and before school care, holiday programs, and structured  activities dominated and organised by adults. A child is not simply an investment  unit where inputs now promise later returns. All adult caregivers should  respect children's right to dream, potter and play freely.</p>
      <p><strong>9. Introduce  maternity and paternity leave with pay.</strong><br>
  European-style parental leave of two to three years,  involving the right to return to previous job, as practised in France, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Britain has recently  followed suit, introducing parental leave for two years. The Australian  Industrial Relations Commission, following the ACTU test case, recommended an  immediate extension of parental leave to two years and the right to part time  work.&nbsp; Offer parents a choice between  home-care allowance or funds for a high-quality childcare place - as in Finland, Norway and France.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Support  fathers&rsquo; involvement in children&rsquo;s lives.</strong><br>
  No mother should be left isolated and alone with  the task of mothering, and no father should be expected  to be disengaged from his children and family. Involved fathers help children  flourish. The Parent and Child Support Centres should be father-friendly - ie.  have posters of fathers and children, not just mothers, and have information on  fathering and fathers&rsquo; networks as a clear message that fathers are essential;  that some fathers share the care or are primary caregivers, and are a part of  the parenting community. Introduce paid paternity leave for up to four weeks at  time of birth. Also, workplace agreements that accommodate fathers&rsquo; need to  spend adequate time with their families, and fathers&rsquo; occasional need for  carer&rsquo;s leave. </p>
      <p><strong>11. Workplace Reform: encourage mother/father-friendly workplaces.</strong><br>
        Workplace-based childcare, with guaranteed breastfeeding  breaks.<br>
        Right to part time work for  primary caregiver with children under school age. <br>
        Right to work a 6-hour day (with reduced pay) until child  is 8 years (as in Sweden). <br>
        Expand carer&rsquo;s sick leave. <br>
        Introduce the 35-hour week. Families need time all  together.<br>
      Gradual Transition back to work  after maternity or parental leave. The primary caregiver should not be given  little choice but to return suddenly to a full working week, with babies in  childcare for ten hours a day: an extreme separation model.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Free re-training and remission of education  expenses for all primary caregivers on re-entry to workplace.</strong><br>
  The entire  visible economy depends upon the invisible heart: unpaid caring work. All of  society benefits from this vital work. Yet caregivers often suffer a life-long  &lsquo;care penalty&rsquo; for performing this task. In any just, fair and sustainable  society it is wrong to &lsquo;free ride&rsquo; on caring labour while giving little in  return.&nbsp; Unpaid work should also be part  of the census data.</p>
      <p><strong>13. Universal free, non-compulsory Preschool       for 3 and 4 year olds.</strong><br>
      All pre-schools and childcare centres to have  open-door policy to parents, allowing for graduated and child-led separation  from parents (as in the Swedish &lsquo;open pre-school&rsquo; system).</p>
      <p><strong>14. Legislate  against all corporal punishment of children.</strong><br>
        Abolish all corporal punishment at  home and in all educational institutions, in line with our obligations under  &lsquo;Article 19&rsquo; of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This has already  been accomplished in 19 nations, and there are several more countries preparing  to legislate to protect children from violence.</p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>15. Prohibit television, print and in-school advertising and  marketing that targets children under 12.</strong><br>
      This has already been done in Scandinavia, and more  countries are considering reform to their advertising codes. Children are to be  respected as children, not exploited as consumers. </p>
