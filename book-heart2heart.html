      <p><em>Parenting Heart to Heart talks warmly and straightforwardly to the parent. It powerfully supports the reader to access the deepest love and connection that comes from nurturing relationships.</em></p>
      <p><em>This book has given me a simple yet invaluable process to live by, and pass on to the many generations of parents and children in my life and beyond.</em><br>

      <p><em>Heart to heart parenting is an exceptional book. Rather than tips and one-size-fits-all advice, Robin Grille offers a gentle guide to the authentic heart of parenting. His step-by-step approach supports parents through each stage to find the joy, fulfillment and immense personal growth that the ordinary task of parenting promises, for parents and children alike.

      <p><em>Inside every parent is the blueprint to intuit exactly what is right for their children &shy; beyond formulas and fads. Robin Grill ignites that blueprint, validates its wisdom and provokes it into action in a book that dares to give parents back their dignity and their sovereignty. In so doing, Heart to Heart Parenting is a journey into meaningful, authentic connection with ourselves and our children, and a discovery of our human birthright &shy; peace and love.</em><span class="quote"><br>
