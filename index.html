      <h2>Emotion, emotional intelligence and our emotional health</h2>
      <p>Emotion is an essential aspect of interpersonal communication. The capacity 
        to feel is what makes us human, and what connects us to one another. <a href="ei.html">Emotional 
        intelligence</a> is what helps us to achieve our potential, and to fulfil 
        our hearts&#8217; ambitions. So, the more we develop and refine our emotional 
        intelligence the more we can enjoy fulfilling relationships, realize our 
        deepest longings, manage life&#8217;s conflicts with grace, and create 
        fair, peaceful and sustainable societies. </p>
      <p>Many of the experiences we have in childhood leave a lasting emotional 
        impression, even if we don&#8217;t consciously recall them. Childhood 
        therefore has a profound influence on how we relate to each other as adults.</p>
      <p>The good news is there is a lot we can do to develop our emotional intelligence 
        as adults. <a href="counselling.html">Counselling or psychotherapy</a> 
        can do much to help us develop our emotional health. Conflicts and difficulties 
        can be turned into opportunities for learning, healing and growth.</p>
      <p>Nurturing our emotional health can transform our relationships, 
        and in fact, it can change the world.</p>
      <p>Since our childhood experiences so strongly influence our emotional health, 
        the way we raise our children is of profound consequence. </p>

An empowering book for parents, Heart To Heart Parenting is more than just a 'how to' book about raising happy and resilient children. It aims to help you create a deep and lasting relationship that is unique to you and your child. Using techniques that are based on connection rather than shaming, manipulation and punishment, Robin Grille introduces you to insightful and practical ways to benefit your child's emotional well-being and social development </p>
      <p><span class="quote">Heart to heart parenting is an exceptional book. Rather than tips and one-size-fits-all advice, Robin Grille offers a gentle guide to the authentic heart of parenting. His step-by-step approach supports parents through each stage to find the joy, fulfillment and immense personal growth that the ordinary task of parenting promises, for parents and children alike.</span><br>
