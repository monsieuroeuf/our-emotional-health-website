      <hr><h4> <a name="acclaim"></a>More acclaim for &#8216;Parenting for a Peaceful 
        World&#8217;:</h4>
      <p>&quot;Stunning, absolutely fascinating! You'll never 
        think about childhood the same way again...&quot;<br>
        <span class="quoteSource">Sandy McCutcheon, ABC Radio National</span> </p>
      <p>&#8216;I believe that the framework for change provided in Robin Grille&#8217;s 
        book will become essential reading&#8217;.<br>
        <span class="quoteSource">Victor R Evatt<br>
        President, Australian Association of Infant Mental Health, NSW branch</span>.</p>
      <p>&#8216;Here is the 'how to do it' path to a fairer, more egalitarian 
        society. If you aspire to a future of happy children raised in a happy 
        society, this is the book for you. Passionate, eloquent, scholarly yet 
        accessible--in a word, brilliant!&#8217;<br>
        <span class="quoteSource">Dr John Cunningham, 
        Department of Psychology, 
      Macquarie University, Australia</span></p>
      <p>&#8216;Robin&#8217;s reverence for children and sincerity about seeing 
        their needs are met makes this a very important book. In particular, the 
        practical childcare information in this book is not readily available 
        to parents and carers. It is unfair for such information to be confined 
        to academic realms - we need it now. Fortunately, Robin is able to present 
        academic information in a readily accessible way.</p>
      <p>Robin Grille does not &#8220;sit on fences&#8221; &#8211; his passion 
        is compelling and convincing. I would love anyone who cares about, or 
        who is entrusted with the care of children to read this book, to learn 
        from it, and to help promote the vision of healthy children in a healthy 
        world&#8217;.<br>

        By Heart&#8217;.</span></p>
      <p>&#8216;Reading &#8216;Parenting for a Peaceful World&#8217; rekindled 
        my desire to change how we treat children (and ourselves) and it excites 
        me that Robin's vast knowledge and resources are now available in print&#8217;.<br>

        co-author of Wellness Workbook, co-founder of Alliance for Transforming 
        the Lives of Children</span>.</p>
      <p>Robin Grille&#8217;s book is filled with gems for anyone passionate about our future. This book should be required reading for all parents, politicians, social change activists, teachers, leaders and visionaries.<br>
        <span class="quoteSource">Kali Wendorf, editor, Byronchild magazine, Australia</span></p>
      <p>What a marvellous parenting book! The message of Robin Grille&#8217;s book is instructive, timely, and vital. As well as for parents, politicians, and the public generally, &#8216;Parenting for a Peaceful World&#8217; is a must read for anyone and everyone in the child development profession.<br>
