      <H1>Why Emotional Intelligence Matters</H1>
      <h4>Emotional intelligence research and child emotional intelligence</h4>
      <p>It has finally been acknowledged that &#8216;emotional intelligence&#8217; 
        is more important than IQ when it comes to &#8216;people skills&#8217; 
        - success in career, in personal and business relationships, and in <a href="book-peacefulWorld.html">raising 
        fulfilled children</a>.</p>
      <p>Emotional intelligence is what enables us to have healthy, fulfilling 
        and harmonious relationships. It is essential for friendships, families, 
        communities, and organizations to function harmoniously. In fact, emotional 
        intelligence ultimately drives democracy, international relationships, 
        and even the way we relate to our natural environment. Emotional intelligence 
        is crucial at every level of human relations: personal, family, communal 
        and global.</p>
      <p>New and groundbreaking emotional intelligence research has shown us that 
        the first few years of life are of particular importance and long lasting 
        consequence to our emotional health. Child emotional intelligence begins 
        to develop in earliest childhood. </p>
      <p>Emotional intelligence plays a vital role in parenting, for it helps 
        us to respond appropriately to our children&#8217;s needs. For instance, 
        our emotional attunement helps us to interpret our baby&#8217;s cries: 
        when is it a tired cry, a hungry cry, a lonely cry or a scared cry? Emotional 
        intelligence helps us to listen to our children with empathy, and to set 
        clear boundaries of behaviour with them without punishing or shaming them. 
        My new book: &#8216;<a href="book-peacefulWorld.html">Parenting for a Peaceful World</a>&#8217; 
        which explores and explains current emotional intelligenceresearch and 
        shows how 'child emotional intelligence' can be supported at each stage 
        of early childhood emotional development.</p>
      <p>I invite you to try my <a href="pdf/eiQuestionnaire.pdf">emotional intelligence 
        test</a>, it will help you to gain insight into your own emotional make-up 
        and to understand more about what is meant by &#8216;emotional intelligence&#8217;.</p>
