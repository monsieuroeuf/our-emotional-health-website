      <h4>Private Counselling - Northern Beaches area - Sydney Australia.<br> 
        Telephone 
        counselling - anywhere in the world.</h4>
      <p>Counselling and psychotherapy are intended to bring you increased self-esteem, 
        and a greater capacity for aliveness, joy and pleasure. Counselling and 
        psychotherapy open your heart to a far deeper appreciation of yourself, 
        connecting you to your personal life-purpose, deepening your love of life 
        and bringing more fulfilment to your work, family relationship.</p>
      <p>Although most of us can claim to be &#8216;fine&#8217; or &#8216;OK&#8217; 
        most of the time, many of us have some trouble accessing our feelings, 
        and appropriately communicating our feelings and needs to others. Sometimes, 
        we find it difficult to hear and understand the feelings and needs of 
        important people in our lives, such as our partners, our children, our 
        friends and our work colleagues. Our relationships suffer as a result. 
        Any committed relationship, whether business or personal, requires a great 
        deal of &#8216;<a href="ei.html">emotionally intelligent</a>&#8217; communication 
        &#8212; not just to stay &#8216;together&#8217;, but to remain vital and 
        dynamic.</p>
      <p>Life, with its pain and joys, could be considered a &#8216;big school&#8217; 
        for the emotions. Counselling and psychotherapy offer many ways to develop 
        our emotional intelligence and relationship skills. To a significant extent, 
        the emotional injuries of childhood that influence our relating can be 
        healed with therapy.</p>
